# multivariateBenchmark

This repository contains the necessary code to generate multivariate probabilistic solar irradiance benchmark forecasts,
as published in [1]. The proposed benchmark (multivariate probabilistic ensemble, MuPEn) generalizes the complete-history 
persistence ensemble (CH-PeEn) to the multivariate case. The proposed benchmark model requires a forecast issue time and 
a forecast horizon to construct a multivariate empirical distribution of historical clear-sky index measurements from 
which a multivariate ensemble forecast can be sampled.

Note that the data need to be downloaded separately and that functions are available for that as well.
